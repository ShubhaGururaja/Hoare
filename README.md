#### Configure Pipeline Sources
Fork the following two (2) repositories:
  
  * https://github.com/shimib/Horae
  * https://github.com/shimib/project-examples (Make sure you fork the following branch: eplus-v2-orbitera or simply "all branches")
  
Next we'll need to modify some of the configuration in the forked code. 

Go to Horae/pipelines/base_init.yml and modify the following values based on your github path.

> Horae/pipelines/base_init.yml:  

resources:  
  \- name: demo_gitRepo  
    type: GitRepo  
    configuration:  
      path: [**your_Github_username**]/Horae  
      gitProvider: GitHub  
  \- name: gitRepo_code  
    type: GitRepo  
    configuration:  
      path: [**your_Github_username**]/project-examples  
      gitProvider: GitHub  
      branches:  
        include: eplus-v2-orbitera  

Go to Horae/pipelines/more_resources.yml and modify the following values based on your artifactory server name.

> Horae/pipelines/more_resources.yml:  

  \- name:           Distribution_Rule  
    type:           DistributionRule  
    configuration:  
      sourceDistribution:   Distribution  
      serviceName:          [**servername**]  
      siteName:             "[**servername**]"  
      cityName:             "\*"  
      countryCodes:  
        \- "\*"  
        
Add your forked repository (forked from **shimib/Horae**) as a pipelines source
You can follow the instructions [here | https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Managing+Pipeline+Sources#ManagingPipelineSources-AddingaPipelineSource(SingleBranch)] to add a "Single-branch" source

> Note: 
    
    > E+ Trial: Use -- 
        Pipeline Config File Filter : pipelines/.*\.yml
    
    > Free tier: Use --
        Pipeline Config File Filter: pipelines/base_.*yml
  

### Deployment

#### Run Pipelines
  1. Run the init pipeline 1st which should : create users, groups, perms, repositories, xray policy & watch, and update xray indexes
  2. Run the gradle_build pipeline
  3. Run the npm_build pipeline
  4. (The distribution pipeline should be triggered automatically)
